PROJECT:
HEARTBEAT PERIOD:
The heartbeat period should be fast enough that it can detect that a replica is down
before the next request is sent. Otherwise the test script will error. According to the
TA, it's easier to detect replicas being down by expecting a response from a broadcast PUT request. 

RESTARTING REPLICAS:
When a replica is spun back up, it should reach out to one of the replicas in its
view to download their state. We haven't talked about/designed that yet. That's the 
"Add a replica to another replica's view of the store" request in the assignment spec.

VERSION NUMBERS:
Returning the version number to the client in GET requests enables the client to tell the difference between versions of the value that it is receiving from the replica.
Note! DELETE requests have a version # associated with them as well!

CLASS:
CONSISTENCY VS AVAILABILITY:
If a system has network partitions, then you cannot guarantee both 
strong consistency and availability, because strong consistency requires
writing to all other replicas before responding to a client. And if there are
network partitions, then the first replica will wait forever before responding
to the client, and the client will time out.
