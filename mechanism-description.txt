Causal Dependency Tracking:
-We elected to use explicit causal dependency lists to track the causal
 dependencies of requests. (USE DESCRIPTION FROM SPEC SHEET)

Detecting Down Replicas:
When a replica receives a request from the client it will broadcast the 
message to all the other replicas in its view. If the replica that sent the
broadcast never receives a response from the other replica it declares it dead.
The very same replica that detected the dead replica will remove that replica from
its view and broadcast delete view to all replicas in its view. After all replicas 
should be aware that a specific replica has crashed.

Sharding:
-Keys are distributed to different shards by hashing keys with md5 and
 taking the remainder of hashed_key % SHARD_COUNT. Resharding is done by the node that receives the reshard message compiling the entire database, calculating the new shard_ids for each node, dispatches new shard ids, redistributes partitions of the database to each shard, finally throwing away everything except its partition.
